*How to display comments inside of your code*

{{{
BeginPss;

COM: This is a comment that provides help about the script
HIDE: This is a comment that provides help about the script
hide This is a comment that provides help about the script

output 'Hello World';

EndPss;
}}}

Lets pretend I wanted to my friend "Jill" my .pss page. I would send her the file, she would open it, but she had no idea what any of it did. By using the above function now she does!

It's simple, anything on the same line after "COM:", "HIDE:", or "hide" will not do anything. So you can write little messages here if you wish and it will interfere in the script in no way shape or form.

Many choose to use it if other people are going to read their script, or to remind themselves what different things do.
