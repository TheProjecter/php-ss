PSS / Php-ss stands for <b><u>P</u></b>hp <b><u>S</u></b>imple <b><u>S</u></b>yntax.

It is aimed at those who wish not to use PHP to its full extent, but rather just get a bit of dynamic content going.

PSS uses PHP and .htaccess (Will explain later) to make its own language syntax.

If you are looking to create just a little bit of dynamic content on your page, this is the language for you. Its also incredibly simple to learn.

Designers, you may also want to use it to aid in designing.
